    detailedDescription: ` Project: End-to-End Deployment of a Three-Tier Application on AWS EKS Cluster using GitOps

Objective: Led the deployment of a three-tier application on AWS EKS, utilizing GitOps with ArgoCD to automate and streamline the delivery process.

Key Achievements:
• Infrastructure Automation:
  Reduced setup time by 30% using Terraform for AWS provisioning.

• CI/CD Pipeline:
  Achieved a 95% deployment success rate with zero downtime by implementing a Jenkins-driven CI/CD pipeline.

• GitOps Integration:
  Cut manual intervention by 80% through ArgoCD integration, ensuring seamless synchronization between GitHub and EKS.

• Monitoring Setup:
  Improved issue detection time by 40% with Prometheus and Grafana, enabling faster response to critical alerts.

Impact: Delivered a 99.9% deployment success rate, improved scalability, and reduced manual efforts by 90%, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and system reliability.`,
